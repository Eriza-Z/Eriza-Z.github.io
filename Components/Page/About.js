      <p>
        I am a High School Student from Indonesia, currently at 6th semester of
        my school (God, time fly so fast isn't it?), and I'm a teenager
      </p>
      <p>
        I love reading, listening music, and playing games.<br/>
        I'm not a kind of creative thinker, but have a lot of stupid and
        unnecessary idea.

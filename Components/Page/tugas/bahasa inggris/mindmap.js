        <h2>Definiton of Conditional Sentence</h2>
        <p>
          Conditional sentence is a type of sentence that expresses a condition
          and the outcome of that condition occurring. Conditional sentences are
          made up of a dependent clause and an independent clause joined by a
          subordinating conjunction, such as "if," "unless," or "provided that."

        <h2>Type of Conditional Sentence</h2>
        <h3 className="pt-2">
          There are 4 types of conditional sentence:
          <br />
        </h3>
        <h4 className="pt-2">
          1. Type-0 Conditional
          <br />
          <p className="text-clip ml-8 my-2">
            This conditional type used to express general truths or facts that
            are always true, regardless of the specific context. They are
            typically used to describe scientific laws, natural phenomena, or
            other universal principles.
          </p>
          2. Type-1/First Conditional
          <p className="text-clip ml-8 my-2">
            This conditional type used to express a real or likely condition in
            the present or future and its probable result. They are typically
            used to make predictions, give advice, or state the consequences of
            an action
          </p>
          3. Type-2/Second Conditional
          <p className="text-clip ml-8 my-2">
            This conditional type used to express a hypothetical or unlikely
            condition in the present or future and its probable result. They are
            typically used to express wishes, regrets, or speculation.
          </p>
          4. Type-3/Third Conditional
          <p className="text-clip ml-8 my-2">
            This conditional type used to express an unreal or unlikely condition in the past and its probable
            result in the past. They are typically used to express regrets or to
            speculate about what would have happened if things had been
            different.
          </p>
          The probability of the result happening in each type of conditional sentence varies. Zero conditional sentences have a probability of 100%, because they express general truths that are always true. First conditional sentences have a probability of 50-100%, depending on how likely it is that the condition will be met. Second conditional sentences have a probability of 0-50%, because the condition is hypothetical or unlikely. Third conditional sentences have a probability of 0%, because the condition did not happen.
